# Hi, I’m Sergio

I am a technology leader and engineer with a lifelong passion for computers, machines, and software development. This passion led me to Japan, where I graduated from the University of Tokyo’s School of Engineering. My career spans multiple technical disciplines, including automation engineering, network engineering, and ethical (white-hat) hacking.

I currently work at Sony as a Tech Lead, where I have contributed to the launch of multiple products, ranging from robotics systems to consumer smart devices. My work focuses on building scalable, reliable software systems and leading engineering teams from concept to production.

I have been practicing Agile software development since 2009 and hold multiple Agile and leadership certifications. I also run a YouTube channel focused on AI engineering, leadership, and agile software development, where I share practical insights for engineers and technical leaders.
