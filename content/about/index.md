# Hi, I’m Sergio

I have been playing with machines and computers since I was a kid. That passion led me to end up in Japan where I graduated from the University of Tokyo’s School of Engineering. 
I have worked in various fields, including as a automation specialist, network engineer, white-hat hacker. 

With Sony, where I currently work as a Tech Lead, I have launched several products from robots to smart devices. 

I have been doing Agile since 2009 and hold several certifications. I also have a YouTube channel about AI, leardership and agile software development.
